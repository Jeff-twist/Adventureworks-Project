# Adventureworks-Project

The AdventureWorks database is a sample database provided by Microsoft that is used to demonstrate various features of SQL Server. The database contains fictional data about a company called Adventure Works Cycles, which sells bicycles and related products.

The AdventureWorks database has been used as the basis for many tutorials and articles on SQL Server, and is a great way to practice SQL queries and learn more about database development.

The AdventureWorks database is available in different versions, including AdventureWorks2019, AdventureWorks2017, and AdventureWorks2014. Each version of the database contains a slightly different schema and data, so you can choose the version that suits your needs.
